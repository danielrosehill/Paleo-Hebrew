# Paleo Hebrew projects

This Github repository contains various projects I have undertaken to raise awareness of Paleo Hebrew (known in Modern Hebrew as כתב עברי)— an ancient variant of the Hebrew alphabet that was in use during the times of the Tanakh.

The main project so far is the Paleo ברכנים that I typed up manually. I did this after exhausting all other options — including Ashurit-to-Paleo automatic transcription.

If you are printing a copy please treat the material with the appropriate reverence; discard in a gneizah etc.
